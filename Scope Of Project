Automation testing scope:

[A]	Functionality Testing: Verify that all website features and functions work as expected.
	This includes testing login and registration processes, searching for products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
	
[B]	Navigation Testing: Ensure that users can easily navigate through different sections of the website, 
	such as product categories, individual product pages, and the shopping cart.
	
[C]	User Interface Testing: Validate the appearance and layout of the website across different browsers and devices.
	Ensure that the UI elements are properly displayed, and there are no visual glitches or alignment issues.
	
[D]	Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing: Test the website's compatibility and functionality across various browsers 
	like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. 
	Additionally, consider testing on different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and mobile platforms (Android and iOS).
	
[E]	Performance Testing: Evaluate the website's responsiveness and load times under different user loads. 
	Measure the site's performance metrics and identify any bottlenecks that may affect the user experience.
	
	
[F]	Error Handling: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed when users encounter issues, such as incorrect login credentials or unavailable pages. 
	Validate the behavior of the website when invalid inputs are provided.
	
[G]	Integration Testing: If the website interacts with external services or APIs, design tests to ensure proper 
	communication and data exchange between the website and those components.
	
[H]	Regression Testing: As new features or changes are implemented, ensure that existing functionality remains unaffected. 
	Automate regression tests to quickly verify that previously tested features still work as expected.
	
[I]	Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports with test results, including detailed logs, screenshots, 
	and any identified issues. These reports can aid in communication with stakeholders and provide a 
	record of the testing process.
